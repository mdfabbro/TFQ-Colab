# Tensorflow Quantum with Colab
The idea of this repository is to upload Tensorflow Quantum examples runing in Colab.

## Available examples

| File | Resume |
| ------ | ------ |
| TFQ-Basics | We will create a circuit and then a Controlled PQC layer. |
| TFQ-MNIST-Classification | Example using the MNIST database. |
| TFQ-ControlledPQC | Minimum example using a Controlled PQC layer. |
| TFQ-Simple-QNN | This is a super simple example using a QNN. |
| TFQ-Ready_to_use | Just install Tensorflow Quantum in the Colab environment. |
